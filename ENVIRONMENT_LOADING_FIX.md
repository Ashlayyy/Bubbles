# Environment Loading Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem

The bot was only loading the root `.env` file and completely skipping `.env.development`, even when running in development mode. This was due to inconsistent environment loading logic across different entry points.

## Root Cause

There were **3 different environment loading implementations** that conflicted:

1. **`bot/src/functions/general/environment.ts`** - Used relative paths that looked in the wrong directories
2. **`bot/src/index.ts`** - Used correct absolute paths
3. **`bot/shard.ts`** - Mixed approach with some correct, some incorrect paths

The `isDevEnvironment()` function was trying to load environment files during import time, before the correct loading in `index.ts` could run.

## Solution Implemented

### Option B: Centralized Environment Loading (Local Development)

- Created `bot/src/functions/general/environmentLoader.ts` - single source of truth for environment loading
- Handles both local development and PM2 environments automatically
- Loads files in correct priority order:
  1. Root `.env` (base configuration)
  2. Environment-specific `.env.development` or `.env.production` (overrides)
  3. Bot-specific `.env` and `.env.local` files (final overrides)

### Option A: PM2 Compatibility

- Detects PM2 environment automatically using `process.env.PM2_HOME` or `process.env.name` patterns
- Uses current working directory paths when running under PM2
- Uses absolute path resolution for local development

## Files Modified

### New Files

- `bot/src/functions/general/environmentLoader.ts` - Centralized environment loader

### Modified Files

- `bot/src/functions/general/environment.ts` - Removed loading logic, kept detection only
- `bot/src/index.ts` - Uses centralized loader
- `bot/shard.ts` - Uses centralized loader with fallback
- `bot/src/scripts/discordAPI/registerCommands.ts` - Uses centralized loader
- `bot/src/scripts/discordAPI/registerCommandsDev.ts` - Uses centralized loader
- `bot/src/scripts/discordAPI/resetCommands.ts` - Uses centralized loader

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All entry points use the same environment loading logic
2. **PM2 Compatible** - Automatically detects and handles PM2 vs local development
3. **Debugging** - Clear console output showing which files are loaded
4. **Maintainable** - Single place to modify environment loading logic
5. **Robust** - Handles missing files gracefully without crashing

## Environment Detection

The system automatically detects the runtime environment:

- **Local Development**: Uses absolute paths from project root
- **PM2 Production**: Uses current working directory (PM2 handles this)

## Usage

Environment loading happens automatically when any entry point starts:

```javascript
// This runs first in all entry points
import { loadEnvironment } from './functions/general/environmentLoader.js';
loadEnvironment();
```

## Testing

Verified working with:

- ✅ `NODE_ENV=development` mode
- ✅ `NODE_ENV=production` mode
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ No runtime errors

## Expected .env File Structure

```
/project-root/
├── .env                    # Base configuration
├── .env.development        # Development overrides
├── .env.production         # Production overrides
└── bot/
    ├── .env                # Bot-specific config (optional)
    └── .env.local          # Local overrides (optional)
```

The bot will now correctly load `.env.development` when `NODE_ENV=development` is set!
