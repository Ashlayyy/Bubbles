## 📊 Enhanced Logging System

### **Visual Event Indicators**

Each event type now has clear visual indicators:

| Event Type      | Emoji | Color    | Description              |
| --------------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Member Join     | 🟢    | Green    | New member joined        |
| Member Leave    | 🔴    | Red      | Member left server       |
| Member Ban      | 🚫    | Dark Red | Member banned            |
| Member Unban    | ✅    | Green    | Member unbanned          |
| Message Delete  | 🗑️    | Red      | Message deleted          |
| Message Edit    | ✏️    | Orange   | Message edited           |
| Role Add        | ➕    | Green    | Role added to member     |
| Role Remove     | ➖    | Orange   | Role removed from member |
| User Update     | 👤    | Purple   | User profile updated     |
| AutoMod Trigger | 🛡️    | Red      | AutoMod rule triggered   |

### **Enhanced Log Descriptions**

- **Member Join**: Shows account age and suspicious account warnings
- **Member Updates**: Lists specific changes (nickname, roles, avatar, timeout)
- **Message Events**: Shows deletion method and executor information
- **Role Events**: Displays role names and executor information
- **User Updates**: Shows profile changes with before/after values

### **Batch Logging System**

- **Batching**: Groups up to 10 similar events and sends them as a summary
- **Timeout**: Processes batches after 2 seconds if not full
- **Summary Embeds**: Shows event counts and recent activity
- **Performance**: Reduces Discord API calls by up to 90%

## 🔧 Performance Monitoring

### **New Performance Monitor Service**

- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors all event processing times
- **Slow Event Detection**: Automatically flags events taking >1 second
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks averages, slow events, and trends
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old metrics to prevent memory bloat

### **Performance Command**

New `/performance` command with options:

- **Overview**: Overall bot performance stats
- **Event Summary**: Detailed breakdown by event type
- **Slow Events**: List of events taking too long
- **Real-time Stats**: Current performance metrics

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

### **Member Join Events**

- **Before**: 2-5 seconds average
- **After**: 200-500ms average
- **Improvement**: 80-90% faster

### **Logging System**

- **Before**: Individual embeds for each event
- **After**: Batched summaries with enhanced visuals
- **Improvement**: 70-90% reduction in Discord API calls

### **Database Operations**

- **Before**: Synchronous blocking calls
- **After**: Async non-blocking operations
- **Improvement**: No more event blocking

### **Audit Log Queries**

- **Before**: Blocking audit log fetches
- **After**: Non-blocking parallel queries
- **Improvement**: Faster event processing

## 🎯 Key Features

### **1. Smart Event Categorization**

- Events are automatically categorized (MEMBER, MESSAGE, ROLE, etc.)
- Visual indicators make it easy to identify event types at a glance
- Color-coded embeds for quick visual scanning

### **2. Enhanced Context Information**

- **Member Events**: Account age, suspicious account detection, role changes
- **Message Events**: Deletion method, executor information, content previews
- **User Events**: Profile changes, avatar updates, username changes
- **Role Events**: Role names, permission changes, executor tracking

### **3. Performance Tracking**

- Real-time monitoring of all event processing times
- Automatic detection and logging of slow operations
