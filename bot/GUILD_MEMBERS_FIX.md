# Guild Members Command Fix

## Issue Fixed

The `/server users` command was timing out due to missing Discord API permissions (intents).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Required Discord Intents

**File:** `src/structures/Client.ts`

- Added `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMembers` - **Required** for fetching guild member lists
- Added `GatewayIntentBits.GuildPresences` - For user presence/status information (privileged)
- Added `GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent` - For reading message content (privileged)
- Added `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages` - For message-related functionality
- Added `GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessageReactions` - For reaction role functionality
- Added `GatewayIntentBits.GuildModeration` - For moderation commands
- Added `GatewayIntentBits.DirectMessages` - For DM support if needed

**Benefits of Full Intent Access:**

- ✅ Complete member fetching and user data access
- ✅ Reaction role system will work optimally
- ✅ Enhanced moderation capabilities
- ✅ Better user presence detection
- ✅ Full message content access for advanced features

### 2. Enhanced `/server users` Command

**File:** `src/commands/admin/server.ts`

- Added timeout protection (10 seconds) to prevent indefinite hanging
- Added progress feedback ("Fetching server members...")
- Limited member fetch to 1000 members to prevent memory issues
- Improved error handling with specific timeout messages
- Added member count limits and better pagination

### 3. Enhanced Autocomplete Functions

**File:** `src/events/client/autocompleteInteractionCreate.ts`

- Added timeout protection (3 seconds) for autocomplete member fetching
- Limited autocomplete member fetch to 100 members for faster response
- Enhanced error handling to gracefully fail when timeouts occur

## Important Notes

### Discord Developer Portal Setup Required

To use all the privileged intents, you must enable them in Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your bot application
3. Go to "Bot" section
4. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable **ALL THREE**:
   - ✅ **PRESENCE INTENT** (GuildPresences)
   - ✅ **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** (GuildMembers)
   - ✅ **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** (MessageContent)

**Note:** All three privileged intents are now enabled for maximum bot functionality.

### Bot Verification Requirements

- For bots in **100+ servers**: The `GuildMembers` intent requires Discord verification
- For smaller bots: Just enable the intent in the Developer Portal

### Performance Considerations

- Large servers (1000+ members) may still experience slower response times
- The fetch limit prevents memory issues but may not show all members
- Use the `filter` option to narrow results for better performance

## Testing

1. Restart your bot after making these changes
2. Ensure the intents are enabled in Discord Developer Portal
3. Test `/server users` command in your Discord server
4. The command should now work without timing out

## Troubleshooting

If the command still times out:

1. Verify intents are enabled in Discord Developer Portal
2. Check bot has proper permissions in the Discord server
3. Try using the `filter` option to reduce the member set
4. Check bot logs for specific error messages
